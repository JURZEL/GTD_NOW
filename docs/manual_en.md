# GTD Student — User Manual (English)

This manual explains the app's purpose and how to use its features in detail.

## Overview

GTD Student is a small Getting Things Done helper app aimed at students. It helps you capture, organize, and review tasks and projects.

## 1 — Capture

- Quick Capture: use the floating action button (FAB) to quickly add a task or thought to the Inbox.
- Add a title and optional description, context, time estimate and energy level.

## 2 — Inbox

- The Inbox is your staging area. Process items regularly.
- For each item you can:
  - Delete it
  - Mark it done immediately
  - Convert it to a task with a due date
  - Move it to a Project
  - Defer it to "Maybe/Later"

## 3 — Projects

- A Project groups related actions required to reach a result.
- Create a project, add tasks to it, and open the project to see associated tasks.

## 4 — Actions (Next Actions)

- The Actions view lists tasks you can do next, filtered by context, energy level and time window.
- Use filters to find tasks that match your current situation.

## 5 — Notifications & Due Dates

- Enable notifications in Settings to get reminders for due tasks.
- On platforms without native notification support, fallback reminders are available (see Settings).

## 6 — Review

- Regularly run the weekly review to keep projects up to date and plan the next week.

## Advanced

- Export/Import: use the backup section to export your data or import previously exported data.
- Settings: change theme, language, snooze presets and notification preferences.

## Troubleshooting

- If notifications do not appear on desktop, check the platform support and enable fallback reminders.
- If translations are incorrect, change the app language in Settings.

## Privacy & Data

- Data is stored locally in Hive boxes. There is no remote sync by default.
